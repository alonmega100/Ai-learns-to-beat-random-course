# Racing simulator solved with NEAT
Make a racing simulator in Python using pygame and letting NEAT learn how to win the race!

Run Ai-learns-to-beat-random-course/CODE/main.py after installing pygame,NEAT and numpy.

The simulation will start automatically and end once a car learns how to beat the course.
